# Data Tamer wire format (schema version 4)

This document is the normative description of the bytes Data Tamer produces.
Anyone can implement a decoder in any language from it without reading the C++
sources. Two artifacts keep it honest:

- `docs/wire_format/vectors/` holds golden fixtures: a schema text, two
  snapshots (all fields enabled, two fields disabled), their MCAP message bodies
  and the decoded values (`expected.json`).
- `data_tamer_cpp/tests/wire_format_tests.cpp` regenerates those bytes from the
  library and fails if they differ. `python/data_tamer_parser.py` is a
  standard-library-only reference decoder and `python/test_data_tamer_parser.py`
  decodes the same fixtures and checks them against `expected.json`.

A change to any byte described here is a format revision: bump `SCHEMA_VERSION`
in `data_tamer/types.hpp`, `data_tamer_parser/data_tamer_parser.hpp` and
`python/data_tamer_parser.py`, regenerate the vectors with
`DATA_TAMER_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 datatamer_test --gtest_filter='WireFormat.*'`,
update `expected.json` by hand (it is the oracle, never generated), update the
Python decoder, and describe the change in this file.

## 1. Data model

A **channel** has a name and a **schema**: an ordered list of top-level
**fields**. A **snapshot** is one sample of all enabled fields of a channel at
one timestamp. Sinks receive `(timestamp, schema hash, active mask, payload)`.

A field has a type, a name and an optional container shape.

| Kind | Schema text | Wire encoding |
|---|---|---|
| basic scalar | `float64 speed` | the scalar, see table below |
| dynamic vector | `float64[] samples` | `uint32` count, then that many elements |
| fixed array | `int32[4] ids` | exactly N elements, no count |
| custom struct | `Pose pose` | its fields, in `MSG:` order, concatenated |
| vector of structs | `Point3D[] pts` | `uint32` count, then each struct |
| array of structs | `Pose[3] poses` | 3 structs, no count |

There are no strings, no alignment padding, no separators and no per-field tags.
All multi-byte numbers are **little-endian**.

### Basic types

The type id is the position in this table; it is used by the schema hash only,
never on the wire.

| id | name | bytes | encoding |
|---:|---|---:|---|
| 0 | `bool` | 1 | `0x00` false, `0x01` true |
| 1 | `char` | 1 | one byte, no charset implied |
| 2 | `int8` | 1 | two's complement |
| 3 | `uint8` | 1 | |
| 4 | `int16` | 2 | little-endian two's complement |
| 5 | `uint16` | 2 | little-endian |
| 6 | `int32` | 4 | little-endian two's complement |
| 7 | `uint32` | 4 | little-endian |
| 8 | `int64` | 8 | little-endian two's complement |
| 9 | `uint64` | 8 | little-endian |
| 10 | `float32` | 4 | IEEE 754 binary32, little-endian |
| 11 | `float64` | 8 | IEEE 754 binary64, little-endian |

Type id 12, `other`, denotes a custom struct named in the schema. Enums are
recorded as their underlying integer type; the schema does not preserve the
enum name.

## 2. Schema text

The schema is UTF-8 text, one item per line, `\n` terminated. Decoders must
trim spaces and `\r` at both ends of a line and skip empty lines.

```
### version: 4
### hash: <uint64>
### channel_name: wire_test

bool flag
float64[] vec
int32[4] arr
Pose pose
Point3D[] points
===========================================================
MSG: Point3D
float64 x
float64 y
float64 z
===========================================================
MSG: Pose
Point3D position
uint32 stamp
```

(Abridged: the complete text, with the real hash, is
`docs/wire_format/vectors/schema.txt`.)

Grammar, in the order lines appear:

1. `### version: <int>` – must equal 4. Reject other values.
2. `### hash: <uint64>` – the schema hash, see section 5.
3. `### channel_name: <text>` – everything after the first space following the
   colon, trimmed. May contain spaces.
4. Zero or more **field lines**: `<type-spec> <name>`. Exactly one space
   separates the two; the name is everything after it (trimmed). A name never
   contains a space. `type-spec` is a basic type name or a custom type name,
   optionally followed by `[]` (dynamic vector) or `[N]` (fixed array, decimal
   N, 1 to 65535). Top-level field order is the mask bit order and the payload
   order.
5. Zero or more **custom type sections**. Each starts with a line consisting of
   `=` characters (at least 30; the writer emits 59), then `MSG: <TypeName>`,
   then field lines with the same grammar as above. Sections are emitted sorted
   by type name; decoders must not depend on that, since a type may reference
   another type declared later in the text. Nested fields are not individually
   maskable.
6. Optionally, **one opaque custom encoding**: a section whose `MSG:` line is
   followed by `ENCODING: <name>` and then the foreign schema text. The writer
   emits it after every ordinary section and it owns the rest of the text,
   because a foreign schema may itself contain `=====` and `MSG:` lines; for
   that reason a schema with more than one opaque type is not decodable and
   producers must not emit one. The payload bytes of such a field are produced
   by user code; this document does not define them and generic decoders
   cannot skip them. Producers that need generic decoding must not use them.

Legacy files (version < 4, before 2023) used upper-case type names (`DOUBLE`,
`INT32`, ...) with the name first; the C++ parser still accepts them, new
decoders may ignore that.

## 3. Snapshot

### 3.1 Active mask

`ceil(F / 8)` bytes for `F` top-level fields. Bit `i` of the mask is
`mask[i >> 3] & (1 << (i & 7))`: byte 0 holds fields 0 to 7, the least
significant bit first. A set bit means the field is present in the payload.
Bits beyond `F - 1` are unspecified (the writer currently sets them); ignore
them. Disabling a field clears its bit and removes its bytes from the payload;
nothing else moves.

### 3.2 Payload

The concatenation, in schema order, of every top-level field whose mask bit is
set, each encoded per section 1. Decoding is a single forward pass:

```
pos = 0
for i, field in enumerate(schema.fields):
    if bit(mask, i):
        decode_field(field)          # advances pos

decode_field(field):
    count = field.array_size
    if field.is_vector and count == 0:
        count = read uint32           # dynamic vector length prefix
    repeat (1 if not field.is_vector else count) times:
        if field.type is basic:  read that many bytes, little-endian
        else:                    for sub in custom_types[field.type]: decode_field(sub)
```

After the loop `pos` must equal the payload length; otherwise the schema and
the payload do not belong together.

Flattened series names, as produced by the reference decoders and PlotJuggler:
nested fields join with `/`, container elements append `[i]`:
`pose/position/x`, `vec[2]`, `points[1]/z`.

### 3.3 Timestamp

Nanoseconds since the Unix epoch, `uint64`/`int64` depending on the transport.
The library uses `std::chrono::system_clock` by default; applications may pass
their own clock.

## 4. Transports

### 4.1 MCAP (`MCAPSink`)

- Writer profile: `data_tamer`. Compression: none, or `zstd` when enabled.
- One MCAP **schema** record per channel schema: `name` = `<channel_name>::<hash>`,
  `encoding` = `data_tamer`, `data` = the schema text of section 2.
- One MCAP **channel** record per channel: `topic` = the channel name,
  `messageEncoding` = `data_tamer`, `metadata` empty.
- Each **message** has `logTime` = `publishTime` = the snapshot timestamp in
  nanoseconds, `sequence` = 1, and this body:

```
uint32 mask_length        little-endian
uint8  mask[mask_length]
uint32 payload_length     little-endian
uint8  payload[payload_length]
```

  The body ends exactly after the payload. `snapshot_full.mcap_message` in the
  vectors directory is one such body.

A file from a process that was killed has no footer; recover it with
`mcap recover` from the official CLI before decoding.

### 4.2 ROS 2 (`ROS2PublisherSink`)

Two topics under a user-chosen prefix:

- `<prefix>/schemas`, type `data_tamer_msgs/msg/Schemas`, reliable and
  transient-local, republished whenever a schema is added. Each entry carries
  `uint64 hash`, `string channel_name`, `string schema_text` (section 2).
- `<prefix>/data`, type `data_tamer_msgs/msg/Snapshot`: `uint64 timestamp_nsec`,
  `uint64 schema_hash`, `uint8[] active_mask`, `uint8[] payload`.

## 5. Schema hash

`schema_hash` identifies a schema within one recording or one ROS session. It
is computed by the writer from the channel name and the top-level fields with
`std::hash`, whose result is **implementation-defined**: the same schema hashes
differently under libstdc++ and libc++, and may change between compiler
releases. Decoders therefore match a snapshot to a schema by comparing the
snapshot's hash with the `### hash:` line of the schema shipped next to it
(MCAP: the schema record attached to the channel; ROS: the `Schemas` entry) and
never recompute it. Custom type bodies do not contribute to the hash.

For reference, the writer's algorithm is `AddFieldToHash` in
`data_tamer/types.hpp`: start from `std::hash<std::string>(channel_name)`, then
for each top-level field fold in name, type id, type name (custom types only),
`is_vector` and `array_size` with the boost `hash_combine` recipe. The bundled
C++ parser takes `Schema::hash` from the `### hash:` line; its opt-in
`check_hash` recomputes the value and is only valid when reader and writer share
a standard library. The golden `schema.txt`
carries the hash of the machine that generated it, and the C++ golden test
ignores that line when comparing.

## 6. Worked example

`snapshot_full.payload` from the vectors directory, for the schema in
`schema.txt` (all 16 fields enabled, mask `ff ff`):

```
01                       flag     bool     true
41                       letter   char     'A'
f8                       i8       int8     -8
c8                       u8       uint8    200
c0 f9                    i16      int16    -1600
60 ea                    u16      uint16   60000
00 1e fb ff              i32      int32    -320000
00 28 6b ee              u32      uint32   4000000000

08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01  u64      uint64   0x0102030405060708
00 00 c0 3f              f32      float32  1.5
00 00 00 00 00 00 02 c0  f64      float64  -2.25
03 00 00 00              vec      count    3
00 00 00 00 00 00 24 40  vec[0]   float64  10.0
00 00 00 00 00 00 34 40  vec[1]   float64  20.0
00 00 00 00 00 00 3e 40  vec[2]   float64  30.0
01 00 00 00              arr[0]   int32    1        (fixed array: no count)
fe ff ff ff              arr[1]   int32    -2
03 00 00 00              arr[2]   int32    3
fc ff ff ff              arr[3]   int32    -4
00 00 00 00 00 00 f0 3f  pose/position/x   1.0     (struct: fields in MSG order)
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 40  pose/position/y   2.0
00 00 00 00 00 00 08 40  pose/position/z   3.0
2a 00 00 00              pose/stamp        42
02 00 00 00              points   count    2
00 00 00 00 00 00 10 40  points[0]/x       4.0
...                      points[0]/y,z, points[1]/x,y,z
00 00 00 00 00 00 22 40  points[1]/z       9.0
```

`snapshot_masked.*` records the same values after disabling `i16` (bit 4) and
`pose` (bit 14): mask `ef bf`, payload 30 bytes shorter, every other byte at the
same relative position.

## 7. Conformance

A decoder conforms when it reproduces `expected.json` from the vectors
directory the way `python/test_data_tamer_parser.py` does: parse `schema.txt`,
decode both snapshots from mask and payload (disabled fields absent, not zero;
floats compared bit-exactly), split both `.mcap_message` bodies into the same
mask and payload bytes, and reject a payload with trailing bytes or a schema
with another version.
